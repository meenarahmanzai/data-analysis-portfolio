Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository showcases various data analysis projects I have completed, highlighting my skills in SQL, R, Tableau, and other tools. These projects reflect my passion for data-driven decision-making and my journey back to a field I have always loved: mathematics.

About Me

I‚Äôm a Social Media Coordinator with a background in executing campaigns that blend creativity, strategy, and community engagement. While I‚Äôve enjoyed the creative and strategic aspects of marketing, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the numbers behind the work, analyzing performance, uncovering insights, and making data-informed decisions. In college, I even considered majoring in mathematics, unsure at the time how to connect that passion with a creative career.

Over time, I realized that I don‚Äôt have to choose between creativity and data‚ÄîI can pursue a path that brings them together. This led me to explore data analytics more seriously and earn the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I built hands-on experience with tools like Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Business Administration with a focus in Marketing, and I bring strong analytical problem-solving and decision-making skills to the table.

Now, I‚Äôm looking to grow into a role that allows me to blend creativity, strategy, data, and impact using insights to drive meaningful outcomes, tell compelling stories, and shape better experiences for people.
